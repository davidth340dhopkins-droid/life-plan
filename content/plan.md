# David Hopkins: Strategy 2026

My personalized plan to maximize current earnings, transition into a higher-paying career, and optimize performance while working in Tallinn.

*v1.0.8*

---

## Phase 1: Wealth & Transition

- **My 20% Rule:** I will continue diverting 20% of my Tallinn earnings to my Study Fund. No exceptions.
- **Proof of Work:** I am shifting from "studying" to "building." Every week, I will add one small project to my GitHub/Figma showcase.
- **Sourcing Opportunities:** I will map out the HR leads at Bolt, Wise, and Pipedrive. I'll start "Low-Stakes Networking"—short messages asking for advice, not jobs.
- **Aggressive Efficiency:** I will treat my delivery shifts like an F1 pit crew. Optimized routes, zero idle time, maximum profit per hour.

## Phase 2: Peak Performance (Health)

- **My Pre-Shift Lift:** I will do 30 minutes of strength training or high-intensity movement before starting my day. Energy creates more energy.
- **Sleep Architecture:** I will maintain a standardized 10 PM wind-down. I'll use magnesium and total darkness to ensure recovery for my 6 AM study block.
- **Biological Optimization:** I will maintain my SAD lamp and Vitamin D protocol. Winter in Tallinn is managed, not suffered.
- **Caffeine Timing:** No caffeine for me 8 hours before bed. I will use coffee only as a strategic tool for my "Golden Time" study sessions.

---

## Phase 3: Social & Relationships

- **My Presence Metric:** I aim for 3 "High-Value" conversations per week with people who are where I want to be professionally or socially.
- **Active Listening Mastery:** In every interaction, I will focus on the other person until they feel like the only person in the room. This builds instant rapport.
- **Social Diversification:** I will join at least one "High-Status" group in Tallinn (Tennis, Padel, or a Tech Meetup). I am moving away from the lone-wolf delivery mindset.
- **My Visual Baseline:** Sharp grooming and clean attire are non-negotiable for me. I am always "interview-ready."
