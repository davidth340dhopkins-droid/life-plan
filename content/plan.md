# David Hopkins: Strategy 2026

My multi-phase roadmap for career transition, health optimization, and social mastery in Tallinn.

*v1.1.0*

## My Core Goals for 2026
- **Wealth:** Secure a high-paying career role at a top-tier Tallinn tech firm (Bolt, Wise, or Pipedrive).
- **Health:** Achieve peak cognitive clarity and physical resilience, mastering the dark winter months.
- **Relationships:** Build a network of high-value professional and social connections within the local community.

## Phase 1: The Foundation

### Track: Wealth & Security
- **My 20% Rule:** I am diverting 20% of all Tallinn earnings to my Study Fund to buy my future freedom.
- **Aggressive Efficiency:** I treat my delivery shifts like an F1 pit crew—maximum profit per hour through route and promo optimization.

### Track: Biological Baseline
- **Sleep & Recovery:** I maintain a strict 10 PM wind-down. 8 hours of darkness is my non-negotiable recovery tool.
- **Winter Management:** I use my SAD lamp and Vitamin D protocol daily to neutralize the Tallinn winter.

### Track: Social Presence
- **My Visual Baseline:** I maintain peak grooming standards. I am "interview-ready" every time I leave my apartment.
- **Active Presence:** I practice active listening in every interaction, making whoever I'm talking to the center of the world.

## Phase 2: The Acceleration

### Track: Career Transition
- **Proof of Work:** I am building. Every week, I add one functional project or feature to my GitHub/Figma showcase.
- **The HR Map:** I am identifying and contacting the specific decision-makers at Bolt, Wise, and Pipedrive for advice-based networking.

### Track: Peak Performance (Health)
- **The Pre-Shift Lift:** I do 30 minutes of high-intensity training before work. I use physical energy to fuel cognitive output.
- **Strategic Caffeine:** I use coffee ONLY for my 6 AM "Golden Time" study blocks; never within 8 hours of sleep.

### Track: Status & Influence
- **Social Diversification:** I will join a high-status group (Padel, Tennis, or Tech Meetups) to exit the "lone wolf" delivery cycle.
- **Value-Lead Networking:** I aim for 3 "High-Value" conversations per week with people who are already where I want to be.
