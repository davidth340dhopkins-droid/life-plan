# David Hopkins: Strategy 2026

My multi-phase roadmap for career transition, health optimization, and social mastery in Tallinn.

*v1.1.1*

## My Core Goals
- **Wealth:** Secure a role at Bolt, Wise, or Pipedrive.
- **Health:** Achieve peak cognitive and physical resilience.
- **Relationships:** Build a high-value Tallinn network.

---

## Phase 1: Wealth & Security

- **My 20% Rule:** I am diverting 20% of all earnings to my Study Fund.
- **Aggressive Efficiency:** I treat my delivery shifts like an F1 pit crew—maximum profit per hour.

---

## Phase 1: Biological Baseline

- **Sleep & Recovery:** I maintain a strict 10 PM wind-down. Darkness is my recovery tool.
- **Winter Management:** I use my SAD lamp and Vitamin D daily to neutralize the Tallinn winter.

---

## Phase 1: Social Presence

- **My Visual Baseline:** I am "interview-ready" every time I leave my apartment.
- **Active Presence:** I practice active listening, making the other person the center of the world.

---

## Phase 2: Career Transition

- **Proof of Work:** Every week, I add one functional project or feature to my GitHub/Figma showcase.
- **The HR Map:** I am contacting decision-makers at Bolt, Wise, and Pipedrive for advice.

---

## Phase 2: Peak Performance

- **The Pre-Shift Lift:** I do 30 minutes of high-intensity training before work. Energy fuels output.
- **Strategic Caffeine:** Coffee is for 6 AM "Golden Time" blocks ONLY. None within 8 hours of sleep.

---

## Phase 2: Status & Influence

- **Social Diversification:** I join high-status groups (Padel, Tennis, Tech) to exit the "lone wolf" cycle.
- **Value-Lead Networking:** I aim for 3 "High-Value" conversations per week with my peers and mentors.
