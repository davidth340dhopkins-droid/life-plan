# My Personal Strategy 2026

A plan to maximize my current earnings, transition into a higher-paying career, and optimize my performance while working in Tallinn.

*v1.0.6*

## Phase 1: Wealth & Transition

- **The 20% Rule:** Continue diverting 20% of Tallinn earnings to the Study Fund. No exceptions.
- **Proof of Work:** Shift from "studying" to "building." Every week, one small project added to the GitHub/Figma showcase.
- **Sourcing Opportunities:** Map out the HR leads at Bolt, Wise, and Pipedrive. Start "Low-Stakes Networking"—short messages asking for advice, not jobs.
- **Aggressive Efficiency:** Treat delivery shifts like an F1 pit crew. Optimized routes, zero idle time, maximum profit per hour.

## Phase 2: Peak Performance (Health)

- **The Pre-Shift Lift:** 30 minutes of strength training or high-intensity movement before starting the day. Energy creates more energy.
- **Sleep Architecture:** Standardized 10 PM wind-down. Use magnesium and total darkness to ensure recovery for the 6 AM study block.
- **Biological Optimization:** Maintain the SAD lamp and Vitamin D protocol. Winter in Tallinn is managed, not suffered.
- **Caffeine Timing:** No caffeine 8 hours before bed. Use coffee only as a strategic tool for the "Golden Time" study sessions.

## Phase 3: Social & Relationships

- **The Presence Metric:** Aim for 3 "High-Value" conversations per week. People who are where I want to be professionally or socially.
- **Active Listening Mastery:** In every interaction, focus on the other person until they feel like the only person in the room. This builds instant rapport.
- **Social Diversification:** Join at least one "High-Status" group in Tallinn (Tennis, Padel, or a Tech Meetup). Move away from the lone-wolf delivery mindset.
- **Visual Baseline:** Sharp grooming and clean attire are non-negotiable. I am always "interview-ready."
