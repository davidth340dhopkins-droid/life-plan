# David Hopkins: Strategy 2026

My multi-phase roadmap for career transition, health optimization, and social mastery in Tallinn.

*v1.1.2*

## My Core Goals
- **Wealth:** Secure a high-value role at Bolt, Wise, or Pipedrive.
- **Health:** Achieve peak cognitive clarity and physical resilience.
- **Relationships:** Build a network of high-status peers and mentors.

---

## Phase 1: Wealth & Security

- **My 20% Rule:** I am diverting 20% of all Tallinn earnings to my Study Fund. I am buying my future time.
- **Aggressive Efficiency:** I treat my delivery shifts like an F1 pit crew—maximizing profit per hour through route mastery.
- **Expense Lean-out:** I scrutinize every euro. 2026 is my "Monk Mode" year for spending; every saving is a study day.

---

## Phase 1: Biological Baseline

- **Sleep & Recovery:** I maintain a strict 10 PM wind-down. Total darkness is my primary tool for neural recovery.
- **Winter Management:** I use my SAD lamp and Vitamin D protocol daily. I am biologically immune to the Tallinn winter.
- **Nutritional Fuel:** I prioritize high-protein, brain-friendly foods. I avoid heavy carbs that induce mid-day crashes.

---

## Phase 1: Social Presence

- **My Visual Baseline:** I am clean-shaven and sharp-dressed every time I leave my apartment. Confidence starts with the mirror.
- **Active Presence:** I practice deep, active listening. I make every person I speak to feel like the most important person in the room.
- **Body Language:** I practice open, high-status posture and steady eye contact. I take up space with quiet confidence.

---

## Phase 2: Career Transition

- **Proof of Work:** Every single week, I ship one functional project or feature to my GitHub or Figma showcase.
- **The HR Map:** I am identifying and contacting the specific decision-makers at Bolt, Wise, and Pipedrive for advice-based networking.
- **Interview Readiness:** I am constantly refining my professional narrative. I can pitch my value and transition in 60 seconds.

---

## Phase 2: Peak Performance

- **The Pre-Shift Lift:** I do 30 minutes of high-intensity training before work. Physical momentum creates cognitive focus.
- **Strategic Caffeine:** Coffee is for my 6 AM "Golden Time" blocks ONLY. I never ingest caffeine within 8 hours of sleep.
- **The 2-Hour Focus:** I protect my study time fiercely. My phone remains in Focus Mode; no social media, no interruptions.

---

## Phase 2: Status & Influence

- **Social Diversification:** I join high-status social groups—Tennis, Padel, or Tech meetups—to exit the "courier" identity.
- **Value-Lead Networking:** I aim for 3 "High-Value" conversations per week. I lead with value and contribution, not requests.
- **Local Consistency:** I am a "regular" at Tallinn's tech hubs (Lift99, Palo Alto). I am becoming part of the local scenery.
